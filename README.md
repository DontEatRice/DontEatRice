## 🖼 My projects
They are not perfect, because I'm still learning a lot of new things, but I decided to keep them to keep track of my progress.

📝NOTE: Look at the dates!
- [Game of Life]([https://donteatrice.github.io/Game_of_Life/](https://github.com/DontEatRice/Game_of_Life))
  - Popular algorithm implemented with infinite board.
  - Written in Typescript.
  - Hosted on Github Pages. [Check it out here](https://donteatrice.github.io/Game_of_Life/)
- [AVL Array](https://github.com/DontEatRice/AVL-Array/)
  - Based on AVL Tree ([more about AVL Trees](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/avl-tree))
  - Basic operations like search, add, delete have better complexity (logN) then standad lists or arrays.
  - Biggest problem during implementation: moving and managing indexes, here the element's index is his position in the tree where 0 is the first element returned by inOrder walk-through algorithm.
