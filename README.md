## 🖼 My projects
They are not perfect, because I'm still learning a lot of new things, but I decided to keep them to keep track of my progress.

📝NOTE: Look at the dates!
- [AVL Array](https://github.com/DontEatRice/AVL-Array/)
  - Based on AVL Tree ([more about AVL Trees](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/avl-tree))
  - Basic operations like search, add, delete have better complexity (logN) then standad lists or arrays.
  - Biggest problem during implementation: moving and managing indexes, here the element's index is his position in the tree where 0 is the first element returned by inOrder walk-through algorithm.
- [RGB color picker](https://github.com/DontEatRice/RGB-color-picker)
  - GUI made using Java swing.
  - Change colors using sliders.
- [Spotify albums/singles/artists images downloader](https://github.com/DontEatRice/Cover_image_dowload_Spotify)
  - Written in Node using Express.
  - Spotify theme!
- [Tracking number of players online in World Of Tanks](https://github.com/DontEatRice/Server-Stats-WOT)
  - MongoDB
  - Storing and grouping data.
